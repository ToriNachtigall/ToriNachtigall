### Hi there ðŸ‘‹I am a beginner in the IT field and have just started my way in programming. I studied to be a programmer in college, which gave me a lot of knowledge that I want to develop further. I am very interested in topics related to neural networks. While I was studying, I mastered knowledge in C# and also wrote several scripts in C++, as well as defended my thesis on MS SQL Server. So please help me with my training.
